Description: I created this multiplayer web game from scratch. The game is deployed with Heroku, and gameplay is available. I used Back4app (a non-SQL database platform) to store user data. The game is still unfinished as I need to add a point system and fix some bugs with the lobbies. Further cosmetic improvements are also necessary. The backend server was provided by my SoftUni mentor.

Experience gained with: HTTP requests, REST Services, BAAS (backend as a service), Deployment with Heroku, asynchronous code (Promises, using async/await), Templating, Routing with "Page" library. Creating architecture of an application; design patterns and their practical direction; HTML, CSS; arrays, objects; function context; DOM tree manipulations and events with lit-html, etc.
