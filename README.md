Tanks Game is JS based multiplayer game. For hands-on experience see deployment.

With some help from my mentor at SoftUni, I created this game from scratch. The game is deployed and gameplay is availble. The game is still unfinished as I need to add a point system and fix some bugs.

Experience gained with: HTTP requests, REST Services, BAAS (backend as a service), Heroku, asynchronous code (Promises, using async/await), Templating, Routing. Creating architecture of an application; design patterns and their practical direction; createing own web components using the Web Components standard; building a Wepback environment from scratch.
