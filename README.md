Tanks Game is JS based multiplayer game. For hands-on experience see deployment.

I created this multiplayer web game from scratch. The game is deployed and gameplay is availble. The game is still unfinished as I need to add a point system and fix some bugs. The backend server was provided by my SoftUni mentor.

Experience gained with: HTTP requests, REST Services, BAAS (backend as a service), Heroku, asynchronous code (Promises, using async/await), Templating, Routing with "Page" library. Creating architecture of an application; design patterns and their practical direction; HTML, CSS; arrays, objects; function context; DOM tree manipulations and events with lib-html;
