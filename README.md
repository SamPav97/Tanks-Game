Tanks Game is JS based multiplayer game. For hands-on experience see deployment or go to: https://tanks-game-softuni.herokuapp.com/

I created this multiplayer web game from scratch. The game is deployed and gameplay is available. The game is still unfinished as I need to add a point system and fix some bugs with the lobbies. The backend server was provided by my SoftUni mentor.

Experience gained with: HTTP requests, REST Services, BAAS (backend as a service), Deployment with Heroku, asynchronous code (Promises, using async/await), Templating, Routing with "Page" library. Creating architecture of an application; design patterns and their practical direction; HTML, CSS; arrays, objects; function context; DOM tree manipulations and events with lib-html, etc.
